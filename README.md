# Adversary-Search-Algorithm
Designers of role-playing games face a dilemma: The game can guide the player through a sequence of quests, challenges or levels resulting in a coherent story line, but leaving the player little freedom of action. Alternatively, the game can allow the player to act freely in a wide open world, but resulting in no coherent story line. We developed a method of using adversary search (the “Min-Max algorithm”) to reconcile these conflicting objectives. Summer work involved designing, implementing and testing a game to evaluate the effectiveness of adversary search as game control framework. This is the repository holding the main algorithm.
